# Data Science in Python

In this repository you can see some very simple examples of doing data science in Python.

At the moment, there are some `.ipynb` files in here. Some steps you can take to view these files:

1. Install Python 3.4 using Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io Anaconda ships with scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, etc.
2. Install Jupyter: `conda install jupyter` (See https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
3. Run the notebook server: `jupyter notebook`
4. Create a new Python 3 Notebook in the web app (which runs on 127.0.0.1:8888 by default)
5. Input some Python statements to play a bit
6. Type `%matplotlib inline` if you want plots to show inline (after importing matplotlib.pyplot)

Congratulations! You are doing data science with Python. The site
http://ipython.org/notebook.html contains some nice tutorial videos on what you
can do now.
